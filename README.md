# Early Death
Steam Workshop: [[ARIS] Early Death](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=421188880)

Nonpermanently adds the possibility for your CIMs to die early. Disable to get the normal perfect life back. 

Nearly all aspects of your CIMs' life can now affect their vitality. When using this mod, you need to keep the following in mind: 
* Young adults (college aged) have a much higher death chance than mid-aged CIMs. Early to mid adulthood have the lowest death chances. 

* Being more educated and more wealthy can significantly reduce your CIMs' death chance. But education has a diminishing marginal utility effect, while wealth is the opposite.

* Bad health, lack of electricity, lack of sewage treatment, lack of water, etc. increase your CIMs' death chance. The longer it takes to resolve it, the more likely it is for your CIMs to die, assuming they don't simply pick up and leave.

* Being unemployed has some effect on death chance, but not significant... as long as you don't let your CIMs stay unemployed for TOO long of a period. If you do, you'll be in for a big surprise. 

* If your CIMs get sick, the death rate obviously would increase. So, keep them healthy! 

* No matter how prepared you are, sometimes luck just throws a curve ball at you. Everything you have read so far can potentially be wiped out for a particular CIM, if they are extraordinarily unlucky... or lucky. It cuts both ways. Well, there's nothing you can do about getting run over by a bus or simply being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Similarly, if the angel of life smiles down on you, there's almost nothing that can get you killed. Just don't count on it. 

You can see the current balance's probability of a new born CIM making it to the very end. It is in the debug panel, when a map first loads. This is the baseline probability. Everything else will be calculated into this on a per-CIM-per-update basis.
